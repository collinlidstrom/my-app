# GPT-4 Chat App

This is a simple React application that allows users to enter a prompt and receive a response generated by the OpenAI GPT-4 model.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (version 6 or higher)

## Getting Started

To get started with the GPT-4 Chat App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpt4-chat-app.git
    ```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `gpt4-chat-app` with the name of your repository if you named it differently.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd gpt4-chat-app
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your GPT-4 API key:
```sh
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```


Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual GPT-4 API key. Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being accidentally committed.

5. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```


This command will start the development server, and your default web browser should open the application at `http://localhost:3000`. If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit the URL.

Now you can enter a prompt in the input field and click the "Submit" button to get a response from the GPT-4 model.
